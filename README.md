In simple terms, every file of Python source code whose name ends in a _.py_ extension is a module.
The `from` statement simply copies a name out of a module.

* Programs are composed of modules
* Modules contain statements
* Statements contain expressions
* Expressions create and process objects

## Built-in objects in Python

* Numbers
* Strings
* Lists
* Dictionaries
* Tuples
* Files
* Sets
* Other core types: booleans, types, `None`
* Program unit types: functions, modules, classes
* Implementation-related types: compiled code, stack tracebacks

You can never overwrite the values of immutable objects.
